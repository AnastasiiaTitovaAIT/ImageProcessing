**Polygon Recognition**
On the given picture of cards (with simple/complex background, cards may overlap) count the cards, find the geometric figure on the card and determine its type: polygon or not, and if it's a polygon define its type (convex/non-convex; number of vertices).

**Hand Recognition**
On the picture of the hand find fingertips and valleys. Create a broken line connecting these points, visualise it and use its length as an identifier of the hand.
